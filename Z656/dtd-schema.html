<div class="blurb">
  <p>I feel sorry for beerXML. It has no DTD or Schema! So today we're creating both. Download the example <a href="https://nhomenda.github.io/Z656/SierraNevadaPaleAleClone.xml">here</a> and let's get started!</p>
  <p>After that we'll play with <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/">TEI Roma</a> to create TEI schemas really quickly.</p>
  <p>Then we'll see what schemas look like in action by playing a little bit with a <a href="http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/vwwp/encodedtext/VAB7014">TEI document</a>.</p>
  <p>I will demonstrate Schematron in action.</p>
  <p>And then we can all get started on the homework.</p>
