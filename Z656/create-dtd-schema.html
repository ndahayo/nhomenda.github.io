<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div class="blurb">
<p>Create a DTD for the XML you turned in for Assignment #1. You can choose any of the three except Moby Dick. Associate it with your assignment and put it in the correct directory.<p>
<p>Then, create an XSD schema for a different, non-Moby Dick XML that you created for Assignment #1. Associate it with your assignment and host it on GitHub.</p>
<p>In Canvas, please turn in a link to an index page hosted in GitHub that contains links to your DTD, Schema, and both source documents that you encoded.</p>
