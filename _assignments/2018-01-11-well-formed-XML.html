<div class="blurb">
<p>Using elements and attributes, create well-formed XML documents to represent and describe the documents and data below:<p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://info.ils.indiana.edu/~jawalsh/teaching/z656/2015s/labs/well-formed_lab/images/hulk_114.jpg">comic book cover</a</li>
</ul>

<p>Design meaningful tags (elements and attributes) to describe the content of these documents. Try to balance the generality and specificity of what you encode.
<p>You should <b>not</b> use an existing XML schema or markup language; please invent your own!</p>

<p>Upload the three XML files to your GitHub Pages site within a directory that you will use for most of your assignments for the class</p> 
<p>Please submit a link to that directory on Canvas.</p>
