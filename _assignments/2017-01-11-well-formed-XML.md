Using elements and attributes, create well-formed XML documents to represent and describe the documents and data below:
-[comic book cover](http://info.ils.indiana.edu/~jawalsh/teaching/z656/2015s/labs/well-formed_lab/images/hulk_114.jpg)

Design meaningful tags (elements and attributes) to describe the content of these documents. Try to balance the generality and specificity of what you encode.
You should *not* use an existing XML schema or markup language; please invent your own!

Upload the three XML files to your GitHub Pages site within a directory that you will use for most of your assignments for the class. Please submit a link to that directory on Canvas.
